PyCity Schools Analysis

I apologies for my not ontime 06/20 experiment with homework file OT_PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb that I before downloaded to the git hab ontime until 11:59 06/19. You can see it in the download history. I just wanted to find the cause of dissapeared column and mess in the bin column. As I found out the cause of mess in few tables is sign of '$' in the formatting string and in the name of beans. It proves file final_OT_PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb.
